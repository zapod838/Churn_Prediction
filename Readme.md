# Churn Prediction Challenge

This repository contains all the necessary files for the Churn Prediction Challenge on Coursera. The project aims to predict customer churn rates using machine learning techniques. It includes data exploration, model building, and deployment phases, utilizing a variety of technologies and platforms such as Databricks, MLflow, and Streamlit.

## Project Structure

- `data_files/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `Churn_Final_Model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the final churn prediction model.
- `Churn_Predition_EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook dedicated to exploratory data analysis of the churn dataset.
- `Databricks_MLflow_Experiments.ipynb`: Notebook illustrating the experiments run using Databricks and MLflow.
- `Streamlit_Churn.ipynb`: Notebook for the Streamlit application that demonstrates the model in action.
- `app.py`: Python script for running the Streamlit application.
- `dockerfile`: Dockerfile for containerizing the application.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing the dependencies for the project to ensure reproducibility.
- `Version_1.webm`: Video file demonstrating the functionality of the project.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language for analysis and model building.
- **Databricks**: Used for managing large datasets and machine learning workflows.
- **MLflow**: Utilized for tracking experiments, managing machine learning models, and integrating with Databricks.
- **Streamlit**: For creating and deploying interactive web applications to showcase the churn prediction model.
- **Docker**: For creating a reproducible environment for the Streamlit app deployment.

## Setup and Installation
